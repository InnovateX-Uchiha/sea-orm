# SeaORM - The Document ORM for Rust

## Features

1. Async
SeaORM is new to the party and rely on SQLx, so async support is not an afterthought.


2. Progressive
Built upon SeaQuery (a dynamic query builder), SeaORM allows you to build complex queries without 'fighting the ORM'.


3. Testable
Use mock connection to write unit tests for your logic.


4. API oriented
Quickly build search models that help you filter, sort and paginate data in APIs.
