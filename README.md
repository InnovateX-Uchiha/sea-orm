# SeaORM - An intuitive ORM for Rust

## Features

1. Async

SeaORM is new to the party and rely on SQLx, so async support is not an afterthought.

2. Progressive

Built upon SeaQuery (a dynamic query builder), SeaORM allows you to build complex queries without 'fighting the ORM'.

3. Testable

Use mock connections to write unit tests for your logic.

4. API oriented

Quickly build search models that help you filter, sort and paginate data in APIs.

## Goals

1. Intuitive and familiar

Inspired by ActiveRecord, Eloquent and TypeORM, SeaORM aims to provide you an ergonomic and intuitive 
API to make working with databases in Rust a first-class experience.

2. Forwarding looking

We are ready to embrace Rocket 0.5 to make building web services in Rust productive and enjoyable.

3. Strong typed and dynamic

SeaORM construct queries at runtime, allowing you to develop flexible and powerful queries. While
the expressive Rust type system would help you in maintaining a complex codebase.
